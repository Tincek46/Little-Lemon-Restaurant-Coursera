By working through the lessons in this course, you've learned and applied the knowledge needed for
the process of creating a mobile application in Android Studio, from beginning to end. This started
with setting up your development environment with the necessary tools and configurations and finished 
with a complete and functional app that you can submit to an app distribution platform. The grading criteria are covered
in more detail below:

When you submit your assignment, other learners in the course will review and grade your work. They will evaluate based on the following questions:

Is there a wireframe image for the design of the Home screen, upon which the actual screen in the app is based?

Are you greeted with an Onboarding screen when the app is opened for the first time, which prompts you to enter your personal details?

Does the layout of the Home screen contain the following sections: hero and the food menu list?

When accessed, is the Profile screen populated with the data you entered during onboarding?

Are user details presented in the Profile screen retained when the app is restarted?

Does clicking the Log out button clear all data from the Profile screen?

Does the app use stack navigation that allows you to access the previous screen using the back button?

Does the hero section contain a brief description of the Little Lemon restaurant and a search bar?

Does the food menu list section display a summarized view of the menu items?
