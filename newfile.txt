Hello World
Hello from GitHub!
==>>Genius-Level Explanation<<==
What is Git?

Git is a version control system. It tracks changes to your code, so you can:

Go back to old versions if something breaks.
Collaborate with others without overwriting each other’s work.

What is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud platform for hosting Git repositories. It lets you:

Share your code with the world.
Work with others on the same project.

Why Clone?

Cloning creates a local copy of your repository. You can edit files on your computer and later push changes to GitHub.

Why Commit?

Commits are like save points in a video game. Each commit records:

What changed.
Who made the change.
When it happened.

Why Push and Pull?

Push: Uploads your local changes to GitHub.
Pull: Downloads the latest changes from GitHub to your computer.
This keeps everyone’s code in sync.

Summary:

Install Git → Create a GitHub repo → Clone it locally.
Add a file → Commit changes → Push to GitHub.
Edit on GitHub → Pull changes locally.

You’ve now set up a Git workflow! This is how professionals manage code.
